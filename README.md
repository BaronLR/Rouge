A version of Rouge written in C that runs in the terminal. Summer project based on some code from CIS2500. 


to compile the code run make for fresh compile

pi@username ~/A3 $ make

after you can run,

pi@username ~/A3 $ make clean

this will remove the .o files from root directory
It creates an executable in the root directory called 'rouge'
