# Rouge
A version of Rouge written in C that runs in the terminal. Summer project based on some code from CIS2500. 
----WARNING--- 
This is live development, meaning that the code won't always compile, there might be times when I push broken code

to compile the code run make for fresh compile

pi@username ~/A3 $ make

after you can run,

pi@username ~/A3 $ make clean

this will remove the .o files from root directory
It creates an executable in the root directory called 'rouge'

#What to expect 
Things I plan on doing before the end of the summer, 

1. Random level generation 
2. Character level progression and stats saving 
3. Color
