-------Compilation---------
****************************

to compile the code run make for fresh compile
pi@username ~/A3 $ make

after you can run,
pi@username ~/A3 $ make clean
this will remove the .o files from root directory
It creates an executable in the root directory called 'rouge'

****************************
---------Usage------------- 
****************************
To play the game, run
pi@username ~/A3 $ ./rouge assests/room.txt

When the game is running, use controls: 
'w' -> move up 'a' -> move right 's' -> move left 'd' -> move down

Press: 'q' at any time to quit the game and print your results

Press: 'p' at any time to use a potion, restoring you players health

****************************
---------Testing-----------
****************************
What went wrong and how did you fix it? 

-Most of the major issues were based around keeping track of the
Player and the Enemies data in a way that the origonal data could 
be dynamically updated. I solved this by only passing in the pointers
to the origonal data so that there would be no delay in changing position,
health, and other combat stats. 

-One of the biggest bugs i encoutered was that I was incorrectly parsing the rooms size,
X and Y was flipped for sizes EX. XXY instead of YXX. This causes more subsequent hotfixes and bugs
that could have been possibly imagined.

-Obviously, there were many minor bugs, but the iterations were so small and git commits so often 
that I don't remember much more than the major stuff. 

****************************
-----Known limitations------
****************************
The game works on any raspberry pi running the UOG software,
as it was programed and tested on one. and as far as I am aware,
it runs on Mac OSX as well. 

-If the screen is too small for the game to run, it could very well
seg fault. I have created a function to combat this but I can't
stop everything...

-Player movemement doesn't work if you use with CAPS_LOCKS on. 

If incountering a segfault,
 
----VERY--IMPORTANT-------
-If there is a problem with hard.txt or easy.txt the program WILL segfault. 
	- EXAMPLE: Extra whitespace at the bottom. 
	- If this is an issue, use the easy.txt and hard.txt int the assests folder. 
      they are the same and it works on both the PI and the MACS
